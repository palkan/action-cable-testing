    # Superclass for Action Cable channel functional tests.
    #
    # == Basic example
    #
    # Functional tests are written as follows:
    # 1. First, one uses the +subscribe+ method to simulate subscription creation.
    # 2. Then, one asserts whether the current state is as expected. "State" can be anything:
    #    transmitted messages, subscribed streams, etc.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #   class ChatChannelTest < ActionCable::Channel::TestCase
    #     def test_subscribed_with_room_number
    #       # Simulate a subscription creation
    #       subscribe room_number: 1
    #
    #       # Asserts that the subscription was successfully created
    #       assert subscription.confirmed?
    #
    #       # Asserts that the channel subscribes connection to a stream
    #       assert "chat_1", streams.last
    #     end
    #
    #     def test_does_not_subscribe_without_room_number
    #       subscribe
    #
    #       # Asserts that the subscription was rejected
    #       assert subscription.rejected?
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # You can also perform actions:
    #   def test_perform_speak
    #     subscribe room_number: 1
    #
    #     perform :speak, message: "Hello, Rails!"
    #
    #     assert_equal "Hello, Rails!", transmissions.last["text"]
    #   end
    #
    # == Special methods
    #
    # ActionCable::Channel::TestCase will also automatically provide the following instance
    # methods for use in the tests:
    #
    # <b>connection</b>::
    #      An ActionCable::Channel::ConnectionStub, representing the current HTTP connection.
    # <b>subscription</b>::
    #      An instance of the current channel, created when you call `subscribe`.
    # <b>transmissions</b>::
    #      A list of all messages that have been transmitted into the channel.
    # <b>streams</b>::
    #      A list of all created streams subscriptions (as identifiers) for the subscription.
    #
    #
    # == Channel is automatically inferred
    #
    # ActionCable::Channel::TestCase will automatically infer the channel under test
    # from the test class name. If the channel cannot be inferred from the test
    # class name, you can explicitly set it with +tests+.
    #
    #   class SpecialEdgeCaseChannelTest < ActionCable::Channel::TestCase
    #     tests SpecialChannel
    #   end
    #
    # == Specifying connection identifiers
    #
    # You need to set up your connection manually to privide values for the identifiers.
    # To do this just use:
    #
    #   stub_connection(user: users[:john])
