    # Superclass for Action Cable connection unit tests.
    #
    # == Basic example
    #
    # Unit tests are written as follows:
    # 1. First, one uses the +connect+ method to simulate connection.
    # 2. Then, one asserts whether the current state is as expected (e.g. identifiers).
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #   module ApplicationCable
    #     class ConnectionTest < ActionCable::Connection::TestCase
    #       def test_connects_with_cookies
    #         # Simulate a connection
    #         connect cookies: { user_id: users[:john].id }
    #
    #         # Asserts that the connection identifier is correct
    #         assert_equal "John", connection.user.name
    #     end
    #
    #     def test_does_not_connect_without_user
    #       assert_reject_connection do
    #         connect
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # You can also provide additional information about underlying HTTP request:
    #   def test_connect_with_headers_and_query_string
    #     connect "/cable?user_id=1", headers: { "X-API-TOKEN" => 'secret-my' }
    #
    #     assert_equal connection.user_id, "1"
    #   end
    #
    # == Connection is automatically inferred
    #
    # ActionCable::Connection::TestCase will automatically infer the connection under test
    # from the test class name. If the channel cannot be inferred from the test
    # class name, you can explicitly set it with +tests+.
    #
    #   class ConnectionTest < ActionCable::Connection::TestCase
    #     tests ApplicationCable::Connection
    #   end
    #
